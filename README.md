# TrelloPress – a Wordpress plugin

TrelloPress is a Wordpress plugin, which integrates Trello with your Wordpress site.

Features:
* use the ```[trellopress]``` shortcode to display the content of Trello boards in your pages and posts,
* use ```[trellopress list=name]``` to only display cards from a specified list,
* show a link to Trello cards on related posts.

## Installation
Easy. Download this repository and put it in your ```plugins``` directory or just use Wordpress' built-in plugin installer.

After installation you'll need to supply your Trello API key and token.
